Raspberry Pi B+ Hat
============================

Expansion Board
----------------------------

This is a project template for a 
[Raspberry Pi B+ Hat](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats).

This base project includes a PCB edge defined according to 
[this specification](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats/blob/master/hat-board-mechanical.pdf).
Both a thru-hole and a surface mount connector are provided, along with a different
PCB edge for each. Just keep the PCB edge and connector type that you're using for your design
and delete the others.

The component footprints used in this template are [here](https://github.com/xesscorp/RPi_Hat.pretty).

The board outline looks like this:
